# Disk Space Filler
 A simple tool to fill up disk space as much as you want

 # Requirements

 ## Example uses

For example if you want to sell a usb or something like that
deleting the files isn't enough
people can still recover them using other tools
but if you use this tool to fill up the drive and then delete all the files then your original files are unrecovarable
